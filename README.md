XPEHO alert probes

## Working principles

This repository contains a set of probes that are used to monitor the state of the system and send alerts if something goes wrong.

The probes are written in Github actions workflow files. They are executed on a regular basis and check the state of the system. If the state is not as expected, the probe sends an alert to the repository contributors.
